This source repository is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
It currently performs some analysis of `.vue` single-file-components functionally, but is not intended for wide use.

I have only published it here on my personal github temporarily so I can share it, while I get all of the documentation + goals + FOSS bits written and checked-in.  Please do not depend on this git repository for production purposes.

This work is based heavily on https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer and the `utils` packages should be considered to effectively be covered under that licensing.
